High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details.
Details should depend on abstractions.

Abstraction implementation >>> Concrete implementation

So in violation.go ,we are having a concrete implementation of Zerolog inside ActualLogger
so if there are some errors in Zerolog and we wish to use DefaultLogger then we will have to change 
the field/attribute of the ActualLogger - bad practice

so instead,have an Abstract implementation i.e have an interface inside the ActualLogger as attribute
Here Zerolog and DefaultLogger both implement Logger interface
So as and when required one can use any one of the logger 

Therefore,easily swaping these implementations of the logger without our program breaking.
