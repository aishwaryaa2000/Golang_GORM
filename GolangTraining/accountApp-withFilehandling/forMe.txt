Now we have to include file handling 

-read data from file and save the users along with their accounts
-when user is created then write to file
-when account is created then write to file beside correct user
-when transactions happen then edit the file accordingly

accountApp.txt
User with his/her accounts - userId,name,password,account1,balance1,account2,balance2,account3,balance3
New user - userId,name,password
New account - userId,name,password,account1,0
