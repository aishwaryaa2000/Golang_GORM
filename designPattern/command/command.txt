Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

Command pattern suggests that BUTTON objects shouldn’t send these requests directly. Instead, you should extract all of the request details,
such as the object being called, the name of the method and the list of arguments into a separate command class with a single method that 
triggers this request.
