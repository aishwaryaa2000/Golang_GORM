I want you to create the following structs 
1) Account{name string} with methods(WM) : a)CheckAccount(name)
2) SecurityCode{code string} WM : a)CheckCode(code)
These two check methods will compare argument code/name with object code/name
3)Wallet{balance int} WM a) Credit(amt int) b)Debit(amt int) error
4)Ledger{entries []string} WM a)MakeEntry(accName,txnType[depo/withdraw?],amount) b) GetAllEntries()
5) Notification{} WM a)SendCreditNotification() b) SendDebitNotification()

You can add fields to structs or add parameters to methods 
Every struct will have it's own NewXYZ() function to initialize it

The flow will be:
If user wants to deposit, firstly you check the account details and security details,
if error return, if not, then you will make the deposit (change wallet balance),
add entry to the ledger about the transaction details and finally fire a notification which simple print to the console
same for withdraw.

You can design the file structure as you please
